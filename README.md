410 in 140
==========
A Twitter API v1 server implemented in 140 characters (or less).

Motivation
----------
On March 5, 2013, [Twitter deprecated version 1 of their API][sadness]. At some
unspecified time in the future, API v1 requests will start returning `HTTP 410
Gone`. This project aims to implement a web server for this endpoint in 140
characters (or less), so it fits in a Tweet.
